            <p><strong>Ingredients</strong></p>
            <p>1 1/3 cups of fresh cranberries</p>
            <p>1 cup small diced pineapple</p>
            <p>1/2 cup of pineapple juice</p>
            <p>1/2 cup of sugar in the raw</p>
            <p>4 whole cloves</p>
            <p>3 small cinnamon sticks</p>
            <p>3 whole allspice berries</p>
            <p>1 whole star anise broken in half</p>
            <p>1 orange rind</p>
            <p>1 teaspoon of salt</p>

        <div class="col-xs-8">
          <p><em>Serves 6</em></p>
          <p><strong>Directions</strong></p>
          <p>Peel and core the pineapple and dice into small pieces (roughly 1/4 inch by 1/4 inch).</p>
          <p>Stud the orange peel with 4 cloves</p>
          <p>Put the cinnamon sticks, allspice berries and half of the whole star anise into a coffee filter then tie like a tea bag.</p>
          <p>In a 2-quart microwaveable bowl add the spice packet, clove-studded orange rind and pineapple juice first, then add the rest of the ingredients. Adding ingredients in this order will ensure spices get infused into the sauce properly.</p>
          <p>Microwave all the ingredients uncovered, on high for about 2-3 minutes, keeping an eye on it because it can bubble over.</p>
          <p>After 3 minutes take the bowl out of the microwave and gently stir, then put the bowl back in for 3 more minutes or until the cranberries start to burst.</p>
          <p>Let the sauce set in the refrigerator for an hour or until completely chilled.</p>
          <p>Remove the spice packet and studded orange rind (make sure to fish out any cloves that might have fallen off).</p>
          <p>Serve chilled or warm if preferred.</p>

        <p class="heading">Q&A with the Chef</p>
        <p><strong>What do you do, and what is your typical style of cooking?</strong></p>
        <p>I am the executive chef at Eloise in El Paso, Texas. I am trained in classical French cuisine and love to reinvent the classics -- and also introduce them to my generation to ensure that we have an appreciation for the dishes that made restaurants into what they are now.</p>

        <p><strong>Some chefs look down on cooking with a microwave, but what are your thoughts?</strong></p>
        <p>Besides being a convenient way to get a hot meal on the go, cooking fruits and vegetables in the microwave helps retain more of its nutritional value because of the quick cook time.</p>

        <p><strong>How were you inspired to create this recipe, and what made you use a microwave?</strong></p>
        <p>This recipe is adapted from one of my mom's recipes. When I think about holiday cooking, I remember the sweet aromas of cinnamon and all-spice filling the entire house, and I feel that this recipe achieves that holiday feel. Even if you aren't the best holiday cook in your family or don’t own the fanciest kitchen equipment, you can still make it feel like the holidays in your kitchen and impress your guests with a side dish that they'll look forward to next year.</p>

        <p><strong>What about this recipe makes it work in the microwave?</strong></p>
        <p>The microwave makes this recipe work because the fast-cook time helps the fresh cranberries maintain their shape and helps improve flavor. Guests will think that you're an extremely skilled cook even though it's an easy recipe to execute.</p>

        <p><strong>What other kinds of dishes might work well in a microwave?</strong></p>
        <p>Vegetable dishes work well in the microwave because they maintain shape and color. You also have more control of the cooking process and can pinpoint the texture you are looking for. I have cooked everything from green beans in the microwave to Brussels sprouts to mashed potatoes as well.</p>

            <p><strong>Ingredients</strong></p>
            <p>1/2 cup sugar</p>
            <p>1/2 teaspoons salt</p>
            <p>2 tablespoons cornstarch</p>
            <p>2 1/2 cups whole milk</p>
            <p>4 large egg yolks</p>
            <p>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</p>
            <p>1 room temperature pound cake (store bought or homemade), cut into 1/2-inch slices and air dry at room temperature a few hours</p>
            <p>1/2 cup cream sherry</p>
            <p>2 cups fresh raspberries, or one 12-ounce package unsweetened frozen raspberries</p>
            <p><em>For serving:</em></p>
            <p>1 cup cold heavy cream whipped to soft peaks with 3 tablespoons of sugar</p>
            <p>1/2 cup coarsely broken amaretti cookies</p>
            <p>1/2 cup toasted slivered almonds</p>
          </div>
         </div>
        <div class="col-xs-8">
          <p><em>Cookware: 2-quart Pyrex measuring cup or batter bowl<br/>Total cook time: 5 to 7 minutes<br/>Standing time: About 2 hours<br/>Serves 8 to 10</em></p>
          <p><strong>Directions</strong></p>
          <p>In the 2-quart measuring cup, combine the sugar, salt, and cornstarch. Whisk in the cold milk in a stream to prevent lumps. Microwave on medium, uncovered, for 4 to 6 minutes, stirring with a whisk every 1 1/2 to 2 minutes, until very hot, smooth, thickened and clear. Do not boil and do not hurry. </p>
          <p>Beat the egg yolks in a small bowl and quickly stir a small amount of the hot custard. Pour the tempered egg yolks back into the glass measure, whisking constantly. </p>
          <p>Microwave on medium, uncovered, 1 to 2 minutes, stirring once after 30 seconds, until smooth and thick. Custard will have a soft center area about the size of a quarter; it will set upon standing. Remove from oven and whisk in the vanilla. Whisk briskly to cool down. Pour into a bowl; place plastic wrap directly on surface of sauce so that it is in contact with the custard (this will prevent it getting a skin) and refrigerate until cool, about 2 hours. Makes about 3 1/2 cups.</p>
          <p>Cut cake into 1 1/4-inch thick fingers and completely line a deep glass bowl, fitting the pound cake in a single layer so there are no large spaces. Drizzle with the sherry and spoon in a layer of berries. Repeat a second layer of cake, sherry and berries, ending with a layer of cake. Press down gently over the top. </p>
          <p>Pour all of the cooled custard over the cake layers; it will soak into the cake and down the sides of the bowl. Cover and refrigerate until well chilled, 6 hours or as long as overnight. </p>
          <p>Before serving, cover the top with a thick layer of the whipped cream and sprinkle with the amaretti crumbs and toasted almonds. Simply cover the dish with clear plastic wrap and refrigerate up to a few hours until serving.</p>

        <p class="heading">Q&A with the Chef</p>
        <p><strong>What do you do, and what is your typical style of cooking?</strong></p>
        <p>Personally I do very simple home cooking -- Mediterranean style -- with lots of vegetables, olive oil, risotto and quinoa … protein, cooked [vegetables] and salad for most meals. I love soups and make many kinds. I use the microwave for cooking vegetables while the saute pan is sizzling. I do fish in the microwave. I am not a fancy cook, as you can tell from my books. Uncomplicated, time efficient, tasty.</p>

        <p><strong>Some chefs look down on cooking with a microwave, but what are your thoughts?</strong></p>
        <p>Love cooking in a microwave. It got a bad reputation from lower level restaurants -- not cooking from scratch and reheating frozen foods for customers. Many chefs use it for various simple tasks.</p>

        <p><strong>How were you inspired to create this recipe, and what made you use a microwave?</strong></p>
        <p>I learned the microwave custard for the trifle from my mother. We moved into a home in the 1980s and it had a built-in microwave. She got the manual out and started experimenting with custard, vegetables and cereals. We still make these recipes today. For Christmas, she bought me a microwave, about 1984. Have never been without one since.</p>

        <p><strong>What about this recipe makes it work in the microwave?</strong></p>
        <p>There are certain foods that work exceptionally well in the microwave, and egg custards are one of those.</p>

        <p><strong>What other kinds of dishes might work well in a microwave?</strong></p>
        <p>Fish in parchment, small batch soups, cereal bowl egg frittata (remarkable) and all types of sweet and savory sauces. Excellent small-batch jams.</p>

        <p><strong>Some chefs look down on cooking with a microwave, but what are your thoughts?</strong></p>
        <p>I have never used microwave to cook an entire dish, but different strokes for different folks. Some people have very busy lifestyle, working and juggling between many chores. I would say, do what suits you the best.</p>

        <p><strong>How were you inspired to create this recipe, and what made you use a microwave?</strong></p>
        <p>I like mac and cheese a great deal. I’m also a big fan of vegetables. With this dish, you get the best of both worlds -- lots of yummy and healthy seasonal vegetables with minimal carbohydrates. I used microwave because I want to create a dish for my nephew (who lives in a university dorm) to make.</p>

        <p><strong>What about this recipe makes it work in the microwave?</strong></p>
        <p>The dish works using a microwave because the liquid (cream) in it and the vegetables are chopped pretty small. Thus, cut down the cooking time.</p>

        <p><strong>What other kinds of dishes might work well in a microwave?</strong></p>
        <p>Marinated protein, like chicken or pork with vegetables might work well. </p>
